# Professional-Materials

## Description

This is my updated portfolio page based on my old version--repository name: Advanced CSS Portfolio.
I updated one team project about a Movies/TV Shows search application which I finished with other three teammates, and four individual projects that I complished after I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Apis.
I also updated my resume link and LinkedIn portfolio with my coding experience and reorganized my GitHub repositories. 

What I've learned:

* The importance of scratch: To draw a wireframing before coding directly can help me make more specific contents for each section in HTML.
* Link the navigation elements to the corresponding section in the same HTML page: use href="#id". 
* Adjust the background image in the center of the page.
* Use "display: flex" and "display: block" to adjust the positions of the elements.
* Connect the email link to outlook: use href="mailto: email@example.com"
* Create custom CSS variables using :root{}, and apply them to the root of the page, using "var(--)", making them accessible to all other CSS.
* Use :hover{} for styling the cursor, and the elements that the cursor point out through filter changing.
* Presenting a responsive layout that adapts different device screes use @media screen and (condition){}.
