                        Hi, my name is Jing Li.  I am currently starting my career in Software Engineering. 
                        I've been studying and working as an accountant in the past few years in Portland, Oregon.
                        During my accounting job, I had an opportunity to access to some data processing related work.  
                        So I taught myself some simple data processing using SQL, and Python.
                        In the process of learning python, I developed a strong curiosity about computer languages.
                        After learning Python, Java, and data structures from Udemy and Coursera for a while, I decided 
                        to systematically learn computer-related knowledge through GeorgiaTech Bootcamp since I'm going 
                        to move to Atlanta this year. Hopefully, I can get admission to the 2022 Fall OMSCS after I finished the BootCamp.
                        <br><br>
                        Combing my accounting experience and software engineering knowledge, my career goal is to work in a financial software company 
                        like Intuit to develop tax preparation applications like Turbo Tax or accounting programs like Quickbook as a software developer.
                        <br><br>
                        When I'm not working, I enjoy cooking for my families and friends, and experiencing different recipes. 
                        I am really good at cooking North Asian style food, especially Chinese food. Recently, I tried some Spanish cuisine recipe, like paella, and Gazpacho. 
                        Besides that, Zumba is my other hobby. Hope after the pandemic, I can go back to dance studio to hang out with my friends. 
                    </p>
